## Week 1 Research Paper Summary
  - Summary Paper 1: [@nadkarni2011natural]
    - The paper "Natural Language Processing: An Introduction" by Prakash M Nadkarni, Lucila Ohno-Machado, and Wendy W Chapman provides an extensive tutorial on natural language processing (NLP) aimed at medical informatics generalists. It traces the evolution of NLP from its origins in the 1950s to the present, highlighting the convergence of NLP with information retrieval and the rise of statistical methods in the 1980s. The tutorial covers the historical challenges of rule-based approaches and the transition to statistical NLP, which utilizes large annotated corpora and machine learning algorithms to improve parsing and interpretation. Various NLP sub-problems are discussed, including sentence boundary detection, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, with a focus on their application to clinical text. The article also explores higher-level tasks such as relationship extraction and information extraction, emphasizing the complementary nature of rule-based and statistical approaches in modern NLP systems.
  - Summary Paper 2: [@webster1992tokenization]
    - The paper "Tokenization as the Initial Phase in NLP" by Jonathan J. Webster and Chunyu Kit explores the critical role of tokenization in natural language processing (NLP). Tokenization involves splitting text into individual tokens, which are essential for various NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing. The process is challenged by complexities in biomedical text, where tokens often contain characters used as token boundaries, such as hyphens and slashes. The paper highlights the importance of accurately identifying sentence boundaries, handling abbreviations and titles, and segmenting text into meaningful units. The authors discuss different tokenization techniques and their impact on downstream NLP tasks, emphasizing the need for robust methods to handle the unique characteristics of clinical narratives. Although tokenization may seem straightforward, its accuracy significantly influences the effectiveness of subsequent NLP applications in healthcare, such as information extraction and electronic health record analysis.
