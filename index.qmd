## Week 1 Research Paper Summary
  - Summary Paper 1: [@nadkarni2011natural]
    - The paper "Natural Language Processing: An Introduction" by Prakash M Nadkarni, Lucila Ohno-Machado, and Wendy W Chapman provides an extensive tutorial on natural language processing (NLP) aimed at medical informatics generalists. It traces the evolution of NLP from its origins in the 1950s to the present, highlighting the convergence of NLP with information retrieval and the rise of statistical methods in the 1980s. The tutorial covers the historical challenges of rule-based approaches and the transition to statistical NLP, which utilizes large annotated corpora and machine learning algorithms to improve parsing and interpretation. Various NLP sub-problems are discussed, including sentence boundary detection, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, with a focus on their application to clinical text. The article also explores higher-level tasks such as relationship extraction and information extraction, emphasizing the complementary nature of rule-based and statistical approaches in modern NLP systems.

    - The paper "Tokenization as the Initial Phase in NLP" by Jonathan J. Webster and Chunyu Kit explores the critical role of tokenization in natural language processing (NLP). Tokenization involves splitting text into individual tokens, which are essential for various NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing. The process is challenged by complexities in biomedical text, where tokens often contain characters used as token boundaries, such as hyphens and slashes. The paper highlights the importance of accurately identifying sentence boundaries, handling abbreviations and titles, and segmenting text into meaningful units. The authors discuss different tokenization techniques and their impact on downstream NLP tasks, emphasizing the need for robust methods to handle the unique characteristics of clinical narratives. Although tokenization may seem straightforward, its accuracy significantly influences the effectiveness of subsequent NLP applications in healthcare, such as information extraction and electronic health record analysis.

## Week 2 Research Paper Summary
  - Summary Paper 1: [@9036670]
    - The paper "Sentiment Analysis with NLP on Twitter Data" by Md. Rakibul Hasan, Maisha Maliha, and M. Arifuzzaman explores how businesses can leverage Twitter data to gauge public opinion on their products. The authors developed a natural language processing (NLP) framework to preprocess and analyze tweets. Their methodology involves using the Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) models to classify tweets as positive or negative. They highlight the advantages of combining BoW and TF-IDF to enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Using Twitter's streaming API, they collected and processed tweets, applying techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. Their classifier, based on logistic regression, achieved an accuracy of 85.25%. This approach demonstrates the potential of using social media data for real-time sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights for improving product marketing strategies and customer satisfaction. The paper details the architectural design, algorithms used, and the significant improvement in sentiment analysis accuracy through their proposed system.
  - Summary Paper 2: [@10093674]
    - The paper "Sentiment Analysis on E-commerce Reviews and Ratings using ML & NLP Models to Understand Consumer Behavior" by Priyanshi Kathuria, Parth Sethi, and Rithwick Negi, investigates how machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to e-commerce reviews and ratings to gain insights into consumer behavior. Using the Womenâ€™s E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset, which contains 23,485 reviews from various e-commerce platforms, the authors employed ML models such as logistic regression, AdaBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, and random forest, alongside NLP tools like Vader and TextBlob, to analyze and classify reviews. They focused on aspects such as ratings, review text, and recommendations to establish a relationship between these factors and consumer purchasing decisions. The research highlights the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and its impact on customer attitudes and product sales. By cleaning and preprocessing the data, removing special characters and stopwords, and using exploratory data analysis (EDA), they developed a robust model to predict consumer sentiment, ultimately providing valuable insights for e-commerce businesses to enhance their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
